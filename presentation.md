老师和同学们，下午好。今天我想大家介绍一篇在深度学习领域极具影响力的论文。它是Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition。

Hello, teachers and classmates. Good afternoon. Today, I would like to introduce to you a highly influential paper in the field of deep learning. It is titled "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition."

这篇论文中提出了一种全新的网络架构，它是residual learning framework。在右边的图中，我们可以看出，在没有残差结构之前，随着网络的不断加深，往往会出现精度下降的情况。而residual learning framework虽然看起来十分的简单，它很容易的解决了这个问题，并且还解决了一些其他存在的问题。

In this paper, a novel network architecture is proposed, known as the residual learning framework.

In the figure on the right, we can observe that, without the residual structure, as the network deepens, there is often a situation of declining accuracy.

While the residual learning framework may appear quite simple, but it effortlessly addresses this issue and also resolves some other existing problems.

例如：

1.解决传统深度网络中的梯度消失问题。
2.随着网络深度增加，性能反而下降的问题。
3.训练非常深的网络的困难性。

For example:

1. It addresses the issue of gradient vanishing in traditional deep networks.
2. It tackles the problem of declining performance with increasing network depth.
3. It alleviates the difficulty of training extremely deep networks.

这幅图很好的解释了什么是residual learning framework，简单来说，它就是将网络的input和output融合在一起。作者通过这个框架，设计了不同层数的网络，作者将之称为ResNet。而具体在ResNet中，作者设计了两种不同的框架，即Plain Block和Bottleneck Block。前者用在18层和34层的ResNet之中，后者应用在超过34层的ResNet网络之中。这两种设计的结合，使得ResNet模型能够更深更高效地学习特征，成为处理深度图像识别任务的有效工具。

This figure provides a clear explanation of what the residual learning framework is. In simple terms, it involves merging the input and output of the network.

Through this framework, the authors designed networks with different depths, and they named it ResNet.

Specifically in ResNet, the authors designed two different types of blocks: Plain Block and Bottleneck Block.

The former is used in ResNets with 18 and 34 layers, while the latter is applied in ResNets with more than 34 layers.

The combination of these two designs allows the ResNet model to learn features more deeply and efficiently, making it an effective tool for handling deep image recognition tasks.

在作者给出的结论之中，即以上两个表，我们可以看出，ResNet网络的效果非常好，即使是较为浅的ResNet34也可以和以往最好的网络进行比较。而且随着网络层数的不断加深，ResNet网络的精度不断的提升，并不存在退化的现象，说明residual learning framework是十分有效的。

In the conclusions provided by the authors, as shown in the two tables above, we can observe that the performance of the ResNet network is exceptionally good. Even the relatively shallow ResNet34 can compete with and outperform previous state-of-the-art networks.

Moreover, as the network depth increases, the accuracy of the ResNet network continues to improve without degradation, indicating the effectiveness of the residual learning framework.

问题：你认为为什么这么简单的残差结构如此的有效？

Question：Why is the residual structure, which seems so simple, so effective?

在我看来，在深度学习网络训练的过程中，随着网络的不断深入，很有可能会丢失掉许多特征，但是通过将网络结构中的input和output相融合，可以很有效的解决特征丢失的问题。

In my view, during the training process of deep learning networks, as the network goes deeper, there is a high likelihood of losing many features. However, by merging the input and output in the network structure, it can effectively address the issue of feature loss.
